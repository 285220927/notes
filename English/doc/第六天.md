Here it is, the brand new Audi R8. I really like you know its body shape and the beautiful curves.

And it's incredible handling due to its low weight.

The heart of this monster is a 5.2-liter V10 engine, along with the dual-clutch 7-speed gearbox, it can get you from 0-60 in as little as 2.9 seconds.

Now, all know Audi pays a lot of attention to the details.

On the inside, there's the carbon fiber trim all over the place, and the flat bottom multi-function steering wheel and the fine leather R8 bucket seats make the interior no less impressive.

Plus, this car features 19-inch wheels, all LED lights, a retractable rear spoiler, high-performance braking system, you name it!

In a word, this car is dope!

Cars are just tools, they should serve people not the other way around.

We shouldn't judge people by what car they drive.

I hope you get your dream car one day!
