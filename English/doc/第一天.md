You gotta go to work!

Just a sec.

It's time for bed!

Wait a minute.

Chris, could you please pull yourself together?

This is when I realize that I'm actually a procrastinator.

I wake up at around 10 am. Even twenty alarms can't save me from that.

Then everything in the day has to be delayed, laundry, work, exercise, and so on.

 And I end up staying up later again, which is a vicious cycle because I gonna wake up later again.

But tomorrow's gonna be different. I gonna make a schedule.

I decide to get up at 8 am. Then I gonna grab some food.

Later, I'm gonna be really productive at work. After that, I need to do some exercise.

I promise today is my last day being lazy.
