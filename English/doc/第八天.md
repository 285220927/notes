My house has gone through renovation.

Although it didn't bring a brand new look. Let's have a look.

Starting with my office, as you can see, I'm actually working in my bedroom.

Believe it or not, the layout of a place can really influence your mood and your thoughts, let alone your efficiency.

So I keep this area inspiring and cool.

Here comes our cozy living room, a fancy place where my family and I usually gather and sit close to each other, chatting or watching TV.

Pretty cool, right? Now let's check out what's out there.

Boom! It's our swimming pool, a fantastic place to chill in the summer time.

So how do you like it?

I think it's more about the people living in the house than the house itself.
