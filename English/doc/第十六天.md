People used to get married and have kids with the purpose of having someone to take care of them once they get old.

However, with the better medical cares and more nursing homes available, people no longer worry about it so much.

In terms of divorce rates, they're so incredibly high that people are scared of marriage.

In some places, it takes men a foturne to get married, which makes it even more difficult for those who want to.

Besides that, there's been a lot of horrible news reported about people being killed by their partners..

Obisovly, no one wants to end up in such a situation.

Now, many people prefre to stay single so that they can simply enjoy their lives, not worry about pattners' cheating, and have no responsebilities to take care of someone or to get along with their partners' family.

Anyway, whether or not to get married is a very personal choice. Don't make such an important decision just based on social pressure.
