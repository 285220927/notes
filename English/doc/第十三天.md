Throughout my childhood, I was surrounded by languages.

My home was multilingual and we would generally speak Spanish, watch the news in English, and later, I started speaking German with my dad, which admittedly becomes an advantage for learning foreign languages.

Yet, I chose to major in finance when I went to college.

I certainly did well in my major and before I graduated, I received an offer to work at a well-known Swiss bank.

That work would most likely have helped me succeed in my career and make lots of money, but after careful consideration, I decided to turn down the offer and followed my heart.

When I made this choice, I had worries about you know salary, cultural differences, and whatnot, but in the end, I chose to carry on with the things I enjoy, embrace the challenges, and make the best of it.

Anyway, jobs don't define a person, every legal job deserves our respect. So when you're looking for a job, just carefully consider your demands, your options and go for the one that suits you most.
