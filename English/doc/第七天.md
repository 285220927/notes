经历，从中间穿过

I went through the whole book.

They're going through a tough time.

I have gone through the exact same thing.

I go through the tunnel and see the light.

I'm at the entrance of the supermarket. Let's grab a cart.

There are so many things I wanna pick up. I'm gonna go through every aisle.

Now I'm in the food section. Look at all the different chips. They have normal size and family size.

I'm about to head over to the hot food section and grab something. cuz I don't feel like cooking today.

I'm pretty much done here. And now I'm heading to the registers.

It's less crowded today, so there is no line.

Not only can it save your money, but also it's environmentally friendly.
