========= Grammarly

The first time I arrived in China, I was shocked when it came to tipping.

The lack of tipping in China was alien to me.

Actually, as you know, there's no need to tip in China, because the **taxes, service fees,** and whatnot are included in the bill.

If you insist on tipping, the people serving you **are apt to** deem it as a display of **sympathy,** which is not well-received.

However, when I came back to America, it really **blew my mind** every time I saw the number on the check.

You have to **factor in** taxes(between 5% and 10%), plus 15%-20% of the total price as a standard tip in a sit-down restaurant, and maybe even added payment for things like carryout boxes and other stuff while calculating the price.

 These sorts of extra payments really add up quickly.

In fact, American people in the service industry live on tips.

So next time you visit the U.S. and get some service, you know the drill.

Next time you land in a country that you're not really familiar with, remember to figure out their culture and follow the customs.
