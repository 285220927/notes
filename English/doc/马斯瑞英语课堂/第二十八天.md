Yesterday, I had a bit of a stomachache.

Because of COVID, no one really wants to go to the hospital for such a small issue, so I decided to look up my symptoms on Baidu, and I went completely off.

People can be super creative when it comes to interpreting symptoms and exaggerating them thinking they have cancer or they're gonna die.

By reading those articles online, I felt like I should've been dead since yesterday morning.

I felt even sicker when I read all of that crap.

Finally, I closed the browser, had some water, and the stomachache was just gone.

I swear I'll never check any symptoms on Baidu again!

So you know it's really important for us to have the ability to identify whether the source is reliable.

And when you read some crazy news, always verify it before you panic.
