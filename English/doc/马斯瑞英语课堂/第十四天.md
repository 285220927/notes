========== 自己写，Grammarly 修正

For me, the minor advantage of working overtime is that I can get any time to fix some tricky bugs on time.

On the other hand, working extra hours is beneficial to know more about some middleware‘s bugs or defects that I can avoid the next time. These can make the company save a lot of money that I can get more pay.

Nonetheless, people should get more time to rest. Although we can't get a perfect work-life balance, we should try it with our best. A full rest means you can pay more attention to work, and you can learn to get progress.
