Here's the recipe.

Step one, dice the onions and garlic.

Step two, add three tablespoons of olive oil into the pot.

Step three, when the oil is hot, add the chopped onions to the pot and sauté for about five minutes.

Step four, add the garlic into the pot and stir until the color turns dark.

Step five, pour the crushed tomato sauce into the pot.

Step six, mix all the stuff up and bring it to a light boil. Then cover the pot and simmer for 30 minutes.

While waiting, cook the spaghetti in salted water. Cook until reaches the softness that you like.

Step seven, drain the spaghetti and pour it back into the sauce. Season with a little salt and pepper.

Finally, stir it all together until every single piece of spaghetti is coated.

I can't wait to try it.

Hmmm... it doesn't taste as good as it looks...

I should have cooked the noodles longer... and added less salt into the water.

You can't always count on the recipe.

If you want the meal to taste good, you gotta work on your cooking.
