Could you please do me favor?

I had a stomach ache from yesterday morning till now.

I would appreciate it if you tell me how to deal with it.

Can you describe some symptoms of it?

I just felt sick and don't wanna eat some food.

I think could take some medicine, just drink some water and have a good rest for a few days.

If you still feel even sicker after these, you'd better go to the hospital.
