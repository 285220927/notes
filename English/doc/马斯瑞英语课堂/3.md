So this guy in the picture, is me. That's when I was around 3 or 4 years old.

In the picture, I'm wearing some traditional Chinenes shirts and pants, posing in what was my own so-called version of Chinese Kung Fu.

That was the very first time I got to know anything about Chinese culture, and my first stories about China kind of started right from there.

I remember in those clothes, I kind of felt like I was Bruce Lee practicing Jeet Kune Do, which I also did in college. I loved it!

After that, I began to have a great interest in Chinese culture.

So my experiene with Chinese culture can be traced back to when I was really little, and this picture is the best demonstration.

Back then I didn't speak Chinese, now had I been to China, but I was actually pretty curious about the country and the culture.

We can see millions of photos and pictures on social media.

Many people take loads of picture just to post one of them.

I hope this kind of convenience won't become a burden for us to catch all these wonderful moments.
