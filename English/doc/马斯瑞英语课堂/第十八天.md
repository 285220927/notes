I wonder why younger people are more adept at phones than previous generations.

It seems like most features were designed to serve the needs of young people.

Zoom and other apps make working online possible. But can you think of an app made for the elderly within two seconds?

Even if we don't know how to use a new device or app, we have friends around that can teach us.

But it's harder for the elderly to get help. And they use less features less frequently due to a bunch of reasons.

We consider ourselves internet savvy cuz we grew up whit it, which the elderly didn't.

But that kind of situation will happen to our generation too in the future for sure.

It's better to treat the elderly how we wanna be treated when we get old.

Just help them out whenever they need it and try to be more patient.
