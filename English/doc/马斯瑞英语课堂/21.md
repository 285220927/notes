Yesterday I texted Ian and wanted to know what he was up to, but he hasn't replied yet.

I don't know whether I should call him to check if he's ok, cuz it happens a lot.

Usually, it's that he doesn't feel like doing anything because of depression, and he literally just wants to be alone.

We used to hang out together all the time in school.

At that time, I sensed some of his struggles, since he depressed his physical pains, but all in all, he looked fine.

Then one day, he reached out to me and said he was actually clinically depressed.

And it hit me that his state of mind was getting worse and worse.

Sometimes I tried to make him happy, but it seemed like he just didn't feel anything.

But I still keep trying.

Don't juggle those who suffer from mental illnesses, especially if they share their situation with you.

And don't try to change them with some words like "Just be happy." "You're thinking too much."

The best thing you can do is being there for them no matter what.
