========= Grammarly

In the real world, we all like to comment on the actor's behavior in his movie or show.

For example,  Jiang Wen always plays a bad guy in his movie. It's not right to say that he is immoral.

But the character does it is not related to the actor himself. 

On the other hand, some people bullied or abused the actor because the actor played the character real.

It's not fair to harass the actor who always plays an immoral character and the actor's family members.

To a great extent, they just work and get pay with it. It's not illegal or unethical. We should respect their job.
